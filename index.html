                    <p>As engineers and scientists with a keen interest in civic responsibility and public policy, we
                        searched through the last six years of Hubway data to find the unusual and the extraordinary.
                        With the curiosity of a five-year old, we asked "Where?" and “Why?” and "How?" at every turn of
                        our exploration. Please join us on our adventure through five million Hubway trips as we share
                        what we asked, what we learned, and what we built.</p>

                        for each station confirms an intuitive result: stations in the center of the Hubway network 
                        typically have the highest number of trips, and stations at
                        the edge of the Hubway network tend to have the fewest. We wondered if any outlier stations 
                        break this pattern: are there any stations inside the city that are underused relative to 
                        other nearby stations? If so, why?</p>

                <div class="story-body">
                    <p>To answer this question, we measured each station’s “utilization” by counting the number of
                        trip starts and ends and dividing by the number of docks and hours.</p>
                        
                    <p>Then, we searched for stations with unusually small “utilization” rates by grouping (clustering)
                        together stations and searching for small circles surrounded by
                        large circles.</p>
                        
                    <p>We found several unusually under-utilized stations that are at least one year old:

                        <a data-story-alt="eastCambridge">Binney St./Sixth St and Kendall St.</a> in East Cambridge;

                        walking and public transit data to determine the fastest mode of transportation from any
                        arbitrary start location in the greater Boston area to any other location. From Cambridgeport,
                        Hubway often is the fastest mode of transportation to Somerville, Cambridge, Boston, and
                        Brookline. Only a few distant destinations, like Chelsea and East Boston, are faster to get to
                        via subway. Given this time advantage, why is the Dana Park station utilized so little relative

                    <p>In addition to searching for potentially under-utilized stations, we also wondered if any communities might 
                    benefit from the installation of a new Hubway station. For example, because there are relatively few 
                    stations in East Somerville, <a data-story-alt="default">walking currently is the fastest way to 
                    travel from Inman Square to large parts of East Somerville</a>. Are there other areas where walking 
                    is the often the fastest mode of travel? Could these areas benefit from a Hubway station?</p>
                    
                    <p>Combining travel times from the Hubway dataset with walking 
                    and public transit estimates, we identified areas in <a data-story-alt="east-somerville">East Somerville near Winter Hill</a> and 
                    <a data-story-alt="brookline">parts of Brookline along Kent Street</a> where new stations could help reduce commute times.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our model is pessimistic and always assumes that someone 
                    shows up halfway between buses during normal (median) operating schedules. During peak-time travel times 
                    or with well-planned trips, transit rides can still be more convenient.</p>
